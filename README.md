## Credits
Diego Marrs helped me map out the logic of this assignment and Alex Brawshaw assisted me with the generateSVG() in the index file. W3Schools was a huge help, specifically at this link: https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp. Their "Try it" editor helped me build the shapes in an insolated environment outside of mine.
